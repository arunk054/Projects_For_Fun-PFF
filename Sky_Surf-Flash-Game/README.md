Sky Surf ? A Space Arcade Game Using Adobe Flash
This is kind of a 2D side-scroller game, where the user controls a character on a surf board in space. Since I am a huge fan of Johnny Bravo, I decided to use him as my protagonist. The game consists of three levels, with different goals in each level. In the first level Johnny has to dodge fighter planes by jumping over them. In the second level Johnny can fire a missile from his surf board. In the third level Johnny has to blow up cannons while dodging laser beams. Thanks to my friends Nikhil Karnad and Koushiik Vijayaraghavan for their contribution and support in this project.
